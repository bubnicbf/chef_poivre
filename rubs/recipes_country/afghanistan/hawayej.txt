Hawayej
Serves 1

Ingredients
3 tb Black Peppercorns
3 tb Cumin Seed
2 tb Turmeric
1 tb Ground Cardamom
1 tb Ground Coriander
Directions
Grind all the ingredients together with a mortar and pestle or in a spice grinder. Store in an airtight container.

Rub this spice blend devised by Zvia, an Afghan street vendor in New york, all over beef, pork, or chicken 2 hours prior to grilling. It also adds a pungent flavor to tuna, swordfish, bluefish, and bass; rub it on both sides of the steak or fillets about an hour before grilling.

In both cases, the rub can be left on the meat or fish while grilling to make a blackened seasoned crust. It can also be stirred into boiled rice or summer soups to taste. Makes about 1/3 cup.
