Sauce Andalouse

1 cup of mayonnaise
2 tablespoons of tomato paste
1 finely chopped green onion
¼ finely chopped green bell pepper
¼ finely chopped red bell pepper
1 tablespoon of lemon juice
1 tablespoon of salt
1 tablespoon of cracked black pepper
1 tablespoon of smoked paprika

Mix all the ingredients in a mixing bowl.
Put all the ingredients in a blender and puree the entire mix. Periodically use a spatula to scoop the sides down into the blender so that everything blends together smoothly. Continue blending the mix until the sauce andalouse reaches the consistency you want it to be.
Place the bowl in your fridge for 2-3 hours to let the ingredients sit together and allow the flavors to combine.
Bring the sauce out and let it sit on the counter for around half an hour prior to using it.
