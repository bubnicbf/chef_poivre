Afghan Spice Rub
Serves 1

Ingredients
3 tablespoons Black peppercorns
1 tablespoons Ground cardamom
3 tablespoons Cumin seed
1 tablespoons Ground coriander
2 tablespoons Tumeric
Directions
Grind all ingredients together with a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. Store in an airtight container. Make 1/3 cup.

Can be rubbed into beef, pork or chicken two hours before grilling. It also adds a pungent note to tuna, swordfish, blue fish or bass if rubbed onto both sides of the steaks or fillets about an hour before grilling. In either case, the rub can be left on the meat orfish while grilling to make a blackened, seasoned crust. Used as a spice, it can be stirred into boiled rice or summer soups to taste.
